# GPT4 by default Firefox extension

It's just a small simple Firefox extension that changes chatGPT model from default 3.5 to version GPT-4.
The reasoning behind it was that it was annoying to me that for GPT Plus users it defaults to GPT-3.5 and you would have to change the version everytime you start a new chat. This extension remembers to change the model version for you.


if  you want to install it you need to go to:
about:debugging#/runtime/this-firefox
and load temporary addon by choosing xpi file from this repository
